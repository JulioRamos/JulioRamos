:relaxed: Hello, nice to meet you. My friends call me Julio, so can you 👋

I'm a Brazilian Test Automation Engineer, currently living in Prague, Czech Republic.

I consider myself a mediator: a bit introverted, yet intuitive, empathetic, and forward-looking.

I like working with computers 💻, writing code 🐍, reading books 📚, beer 🍺, and sports like football ⚽, volleyball 🏐, and cycling 🚴

I have been working with testing since 2009.
