:relaxed: Hello, nice to meet you. My friends call me Julio, so also you 👀

I'm a Brazilian Test Automation Engineer but I'm currently living in Prague, Czech Republic.

I consider myself a mediator, a bit introverted but also intuitive, empathetic, and prospective.

I like working with computers 💻, writing code 🐍, reading books 📚, beer 🍺, and  sports like football ⚽, volley 🏐, and cycling 🚴

I have been working with testing since 2009, so I'm quite experienced.
