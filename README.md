:relaxed: Hello, nice to meet you. My friends call me Julio, so also you ðŸ‘€

I'm a Brazilian Test Automation Engineer but I'm currently living in PlzeÅˆ, Czech Republic.
Yes, it's the birthplace of the most famous, consumed, and loved beer, here know as pivo, in the world. So I'm quite happy with that.

I consider myself a mediator, a little bit introverted but also intuitive, empathetic, and prospective. So a little bit quiet but open-minded and imaginative.

I like working with computers :computer:, writing code :snake:, reading books :books:, beer :beers:, and playing sports like football :soccer:, volley, and cycling:bicyclist:

I have been working with testing since 2009, so I'm quite experienced in that.

So now let me code and test some football app while having a nice beer ;)
